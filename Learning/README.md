# Learning how to learn
One of my favorite topics. Lets do that.
I will try to use this page as a instructor to learn things.
## What I currently think that I should do to master a new subject
1. History
2. Best Practices
3. Full Functionality
4. *Optional* **How** Does It Work

### History
Why was tool created? What were the alternatives back then?

### Best Practices
How should you use that? Shortcuts?

### Full Functionality
What is the power of it?

### How Does It Work?
What is the technology behind it?

## The Learning Process:
This process should have as many iterations as you can between:
 - reading
 - experimenting

### Good Material:
- [good video from the DevOps Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8X4Nd5gswU). I should think about using his template and see how that feels.
